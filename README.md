# Restaurant-Recommender
CS102 Codecademy Project
Using provided sample data this program will recommend restaurants to you. It features an autocomplete function that will suggest types of food that's
  provided in the data.
I decided not to use a graph data structure because of the way that the data was provided, but if I were to do this from scratch I would use a graph that maps
  restaurants to multiple keywords.
